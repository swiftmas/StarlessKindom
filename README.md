# StarlessKindom
Client for PocketChip game StarlessKindom


*Note, this shouldnt even be considered alpha. its like seriously bad code. its just the starts of a simple engine for the soul purpose of making this game. I do not claim anything by it. Nor do I claim that this game will materialize the way I want it to. 

Assuming that you have electron properly installed.

1. Install and run the node server for the game:
https://github.com/swiftmas/super-mp-sandbox.git
no need for anything but nodejs. 

2. run the super-mp-sandbox server with node server.js

3. Install this client to pocketchip

4. Assuming its running locally, run the client by cd'ing to the project and typing "electron ." 
 This will boot the app, pull from the server and start the game. Select one of the colored squares and your good to go. 
 
 If not running locally, you can change the server location in main.js. 

Controlls are: wasd/arrow-keys for movement and n for attacks.
